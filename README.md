# Pipox Attack

Fun top-down shooter game!

Pipox Attack was the first code I ever wrote, and it's written in C# using Unity.

The files in folder "Pipox Attack - Built" contain the playable build of the game, whereas the rest of the files compose the project itself.

To play: 
AWSD / arrow keys to move - Right click to shoot.

The game was made as a gift for a friend, so there may be inside jokes. Other than that, the game is pretty straight-worward and enjoyable!

Can you make it to hardcore mode? :)
